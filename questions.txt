1) How many times does the word Sherlock appear in the file?
answer: 345

2) Now that you have a working program, change the job so that only words that appear 10 or more times are stored in the output file. Before you change the code, think about the following question: Should you change the mapper or the reducer? Now go and modify the program to add that feature:
answer: the reducer is responsible for receiving the data therefore can control the output

3) How many words appear 10 times or more in the document?
answer: 3963

4) 549 644


The information in 2 and 3 can be found in the hadoop data, as the reduce input records number is 549644, and the reduce output records number is 3963. As the if statement if still within the reducer method, we know the output number are just the words that appear more than 10 times, therefore the previous number must be the total number of words that goes into the reducer method.
